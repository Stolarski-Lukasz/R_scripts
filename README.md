# Example R scripts used in my research projects

This repository contains examples of data analyses performed in R for my science projects, including:

1. "Demographics of Male and Female MPs in the Interwar Period" - a script used in one of my recent projects titled "Descriptive Statistics of Speeches Given by the First British Female MPs as Evidence of Their Parliamentary Activity." The project focuses on quantifying the language used by the first women in the British Parliament in comparison to their male counterparts in the same historical period. The script itself is an introductory analysis of the demographics of the British Parliament in the Interwar Period and is based on the data extracted from [the Hansard Corpus](https://hansard.millbanksystems.com/). The data analysis performed in the script has been described in the resulting paper, which will be published in a sociolinguistic journal.
